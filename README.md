## What... should this be...?
This is something a friend of mine asked me in 2021, it was about a marketplace of FiveM mods, where users could register, upload and downloads mods, and eventually buy paid ones. This very last feature was never added.

## Development
I worked on this project for months. I had little experience at the time and this revealed to be more exhausting than what I originally thought, but in the end it really helped me gaining new knowledge.

It was the first time I worked with a framework, and I really tried to code the best I could do with all the clean code principles I was learning.

After a few months I started working and my schedule filled up very quickly, and unfortunately this project never saw an end.
This repository was kept private until almost 2 years later, and who knows... maybe one day it will get completed, even if in a rescaled manner
